# Watch L8r *

A simple fullstack application for saving a "watch later" list of all the shows/movies/etc. you intend to watch... just not right right now

Motivation: Built to use for a friend and myself. The hope was to save time when we wanted to watch something but didn't know what to watch.

*name is a work in progress.. other potential names include:

- "Lets Watch..."
- "Sumn2Watch"
- etc

***

## MVP (Minimum Viable Project)

User should be able to:

- Add item to watch later list
- view watch later list
- "check off" item from list

***

## Refactor/Add - Next

Make it look better.. like less of a hot pile of garbage

***

## Refactor/Add - Later, Down the road

- Use an API to be able to look up/search (movieDB api/imbd?)
  - option of "search for show" OR add manually
- User Login options/authentification
